## Overview

This project aims to develop an intelligent and automated pipeline for the **restoration of broken 3D archaeological artifacts** using **Computer Vision**, **Deep Learning**, and **Reinforcement Learning**. The goal is to assist archaeologists, museums, and digital archivists in reconstructing damaged cultural heritage artifacts with precision and minimal manual effort.

---

## Objectives

- Build a robust ML pipeline for:
  - Preprocessing and cleaning of 3D mesh fragments.
  - Classical reconstruction using ICP, RANSAC, and SIFT-based alignment.
  - Deep Learning-based feature extraction and surface matching.
  - Reinforcement Learning-based intelligent assembly of 3D pieces.
- Optimize and evaluate using metrics like reconstruction accuracy, time efficiency, and robustness to noise/missing data.
- Package the entire pipeline into an automated, scalable tool.

---

## Methodology

1. **Preprocessing**
   - Normalize, smooth, and clean the raw 3D meshes.
   - Remove noise and isolate fragments from the background.

2. **Classical Methods**
   - Apply ICP (Iterative Closest Point), RANSAC, and SIFT algorithms for geometric alignment.
   - Build baseline classical assembly techniques.

3. **Deep Learning Models**
   - Implement a PointNet++ or similar model to extract deep geometric features from fragments.
   - Match surface contours and edge semantics.

4. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Design a custom RL agent to predict optimal orientation and placement.
   - Use Actor-Critic architecture with reward shaping for assembly correctness.

5. **Evaluation & Packaging**
   - Measure accuracy and efficiency.
   - Automate the pipeline using Docker and make CLI/GUI interface.
